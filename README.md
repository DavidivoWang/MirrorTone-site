# MirrorTone-site

**MirrorTone** is a practical framework for building **tone-stable, semantics-first, and audit-ready AI systems**—with human-rights-aligned safeguards.

> **Tagline:** Tone × Semantics × Responsibility — engineered, measurable, and reviewable.

---

## What this is

MirrorTone is not “prompt tricks.”  
It’s a **system layer** that makes AI outputs:

- **Semantically grounded** (no guesswork, no invented facts)
- **Tone-stable** (calm, non-manipulative, non-escalatory)
- **Auditable** (traceable decisions, explicit uncertainty, accountable corrections)

---

## Why it matters

Most AI failures in the real world are not “capability” problems.  
They’re **governance + interaction** problems:

- confident wrong answers
- tone escalation and user distrust
- unclear responsibility when things go wrong

MirrorTone focuses on **reliability and accountability at the interface level**—where humans actually experience AI.

## Core principles (non-negotiable)

- **Truthfulness first:** no hallucination, no carrying forward errors  
- **No flattery / no manipulation:** clarity over persuasion  
- **No probability-style guessing:** if uncertain → pause, verify, or abstain  
- **Human-rights aligned:** dignity, privacy, non-violence, due process  
- **Auditability:** decisions and corrections must be explainable and traceable
